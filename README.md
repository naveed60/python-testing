File: authenticated_system.rb
Summary:
The AuthenticatedSystem module handles authentication logic in the Rails 2 application. It provides methods to check login status, manage sessions, and handle user authentication through session, basic auth, or cookies.
Key Features:
Authentication Checks:
logged_in? checks if a user is logged in.
current_lsd_user retrieves the current user from the session or other sources.
Session Management:
current_lsd_user= sets the user in the session.
Access Control:
authorized? determines if a user is authorized.
login_required enforces login requirements.
access_denied redirects unauthorized users.
Persistent Login:
Supports cookie-based login using remember_token.
Modernization Recommendations for Rails 8:
Replace with Devise: Devise simplifies authentication by providing helpers like authenticate_user!, current_user, and session management out of the box.
Refactor Authorization: Use a gem like Pundit or CanCanCan to handle authorization.
